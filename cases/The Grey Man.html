  <title>Albert Fish: The Gray Man | True Crime Archive</title>
<meta name="description" content="Albert Fish was a quiet, ghostlike figure who moved through early 20th-century New York with unsettling ease. Beneath his frail frame and polite demeanor lurked one of the most sadistic minds in criminal history. Known by many names—The Gray Man, The Brooklyn Vampire, The Boogeyman—Fish abducted, tortured, and murdered children in crimes that blended religious delusion, cannibalism, and psychological torment.
He claimed to hear voices from God commanding him to inflict pain. He inserted needles into his own body, wrote graphic letters to victims’ families, and kept a ledger of his fantasies. His most infamous crime—the abduction and murder of 10-year-old Grace Budd—led to a nationwide manhunt and a trial that shocked the world.
Albert Fish was executed in 1936, but his legacy remains one of the darkest chapters in American criminal history. A predator cloaked in civility. A monster in plain sight.

But Albert Fish was anything but.
Known as The Gray Man, he abducted children, wrote chilling letters, and claimed divine voices told him to kill.
