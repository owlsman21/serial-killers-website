    <p>John Duffy and David Mulcahy were a pair of British serial rapists and murderers, often called "the Railway Killers" or "the Railway Rapists," who terrorized women near railway stations in southern England during the 1980s.

    <p>The crimes of Duffy and Mulcahy
A "wicked" childhood bond: Duffy and Mulcahy were lifelong friends from school in north London. They shared a bond over sadistic acts, including tormenting animals and committing petty crimes. Duffy, who was shorter and more reserved, was described as the serial rapist, while Mulcahy, taller and more dominant, was the one who escalated the violence to murder.
The hunt begins: From 1982 to 1986, the pair carried out a series of rapes and assaults, primarily targeting women near railway stations and on Hampstead Heath. The attacks were meticulously planned and often involved using knives and balaclavas.
The murders: The pair escalated to murder in 1985.
Alison Day: On December 29, 1985, they raped and strangled 19-year-old Alison Day near Hackney Wick station.
Maartje Tamboezer: On April 17, 1986, they targeted 15-year-old Maartje Tamboezer in West Horsley. After raping and strangling her, they set her body on fire to destroy evidence.
Anne Lock: On May 18, 1986, they murdered 29-year-old Anne Lock near Brookmans Park station. 
Investigation and conviction
First breakthrough: In 1986, police enlisted the help of psychologist David Canter, who pioneered the use of psychological offender profiling in the UK. Canter's profile was remarkably accurate and helped narrow the search for the perpetrator.
John Duffy's arrest and conviction: Duffy was caught in November 1986 while stalking a woman and was subsequently arrested. During a search of his home, police found evidence linking him to the murders. He was convicted in 1988 of two murders and four rapes and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Though police suspected an accomplice, Mulcahy was released due to a lack of evidence.
David Mulcahy's conviction: In 1997, a decade after his conviction, Duffy confessed to his crimes and named Mulcahy as his accomplice. Advancements in DNA technology allowed police to connect Mulcahy to the attacks. Duffy testified against his former friend in a landmark trial. Mulcahy was convicted in 2001 of three murders, seven rapes, and five charges of conspiracy to rape, and also received multiple life sentences. </p>
