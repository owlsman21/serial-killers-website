   <p class="case-description">
Based on the chilling true story of Victorian poisoner <strong>Mary Ann Cotton</strong>, <em>Dark Angel</em> dramatizes the rise of what may have been England‚Äôs first female serial killer. Set against the bleak backdrop of 19th-century North East England, the series follows Mary Ann as she weaves a deadly path through mining towns and rural parishes, leaving behind a trail of poisoned husbands, children, and lovers.

Her calculated modus operandi involved marrying unsuspecting men, administering lethal doses of arsenic, and collecting life insurance payouts before moving on to her next target. With each death, her social standing and financial security grew ‚Äî but so did the suspicion surrounding her. As the body count mounted, whispers turned to investigations, and Mary Ann‚Äôs carefully constructed facade began to crack.

Joanne Froggatt delivers a haunting performance, portraying Cotton not as a caricature of evil, but as a woman shaped by poverty, ambition, and a chilling disregard for human life. <em>Dark Angel</em> doesn‚Äôt just recount the murders ‚Äî it explores the psychological unraveling of a killer whose crimes were hidden in plain sight.

This dramatization brings forensic depth to one of Britain‚Äôs most notorious cases, blending historical accuracy with cinematic storytelling. It‚Äôs a must-watch for true crime enthusiasts and historians alike.
