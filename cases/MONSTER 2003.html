    <h1>MONSTER: Aileen Wuornos: America's First Female Serial Killer</h1>
     <a href="https://owlsman21.github.io/serial-killers-website/" class="return">← Return to Archive</a>
    <p>
The film is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a former prostitute who became one of America's first female serial killers, murdering seven men between 1989 and 1990 before being executed in Florida in 2002.
 The film stars Charlize Theron in an acclaimed performance as Wuornos, earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama, and numerous other accolades.
 Christina Ricci portrays Selby Wall, a fictionalized version of Wuornos's real-life girlfriend, Tyria Moore.
The story focuses on the nine-month period between 1989 and 1990, during which Wuornos meets Selby Wall in a gay bar in Daytona Beach, Florida, and begins a relationship that offers her a fleeting sense of love and hope.
 After being brutally raped and beaten by a client, Vincent Corey, Wuornos kills him in self-defense and begins a killing spree, justifying her actions as protection against predatory men.
 As her crimes escalate, her relationship with Selby deteriorates under the weight of her actions and the growing danger, culminating in Wuornos's arrest, trial, and eventual death sentence.</p>

To avoid legal issues and for dramatic purposes, the character played by Christina Ricci was a fictionalized composite based on Wuornos's real-life partner, Tyria Moore.The relationship between Wuornos and Tyby Moore (as she was sometimes known) was a core element of the case, and the film takes some creative license with her character.The Real-Life Role of Tyria MooreUnlike the movie's depiction, which shows Selby Wall eventually abandoning Wuornos, Tyria Moore played a critical and direct role in bringing Aileen Wuornos's killing spree to an end.After police identified Wuornos as a suspect, they contacted Tyria Moore and convinced her to cooperate. In a series of recorded phone calls, Tyria Moore elicited a confession from Wuornos, which was used by prosecutors to secure her conviction for the murder of several men. This pivotal betrayal, though painful for Wuornos, was key to solving the case.</p>
