    <h1>Atlanta Child Murders</h1>
     <a href="https://owlsman21.github.io/serial-killers-website/" class="return">← Return to Archive</a>
    <p>Wayne Bertram Williams is a convicted murderer serving life imprisonment for the killings of two adults in 1981, and is widely believed by law enforcement to be the perpetrator in at least 22 of the 30 unsolved Atlanta murders of 1979–1981, often referred to as the Atlanta Child Murders. He was never tried for the child murders, and has always maintained his innocence. 
Key Details
Conviction: In 1982, Williams was tried and convicted of the murders of two adult men, Nathaniel Cater and Jimmy Ray Payne, based heavily on circumstantial fiber evidence and witness testimony. He received two consecutive life sentences and is currently incarcerated at Telfair State Prison.
The Murders: Between 1979 and 1981, at least 28 African-American children, adolescents, and adults were killed in Atlanta. The murders ceased after Williams's arrest, which prosecutors highlight as strong evidence of his guilt.
Evidence: The prosecution's case relied heavily on rare textile fibers found on the victims that matched carpets and materials in Williams's home and car, as well as dog hairs consistent with his German Shepherd. Witness testimony also placed him with some of the victims before their deaths.
Controversy: The decision to not try Williams for the child murders and instead attribute the cases to him after his adult convictions has led to ongoing controversy. Some critics and victims' families believe police may have covered up evidence of Ku Klux Klan involvement to avoid a race war, and that Williams was used as a scapegoat.
Reopening the Cases: In March 2019, Atlanta officials announced they would re-examine evidence from the cases using modern DNA testing technology to provide closure to the victims' families. As of late 2022, no new public results had been released, despite requests from the families.
Current Status: Williams continues to serve his life sentence and will next be eligible for parole in November 2027. He maintains his innocence and has cooperated with the recent reviews of the evidence.
