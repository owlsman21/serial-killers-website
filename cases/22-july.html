    <p>Anders Behring Breivik orchestrated one of the deadliest mass killings in modern European history on July 22, 2011, targeting Norway’s political youth in a calculated act of far-right terrorism. His attack left 77 dead and hundreds injured, shaking the nation’s sense of peace and security.

🩸 Featured Crime Case: Anders Behring Breivik — The Utøya Massacre
📅 Date: July 22, 2011
📍 Locations: Oslo Government District & Utøya Island, Norway
🎯 Targets: Norwegian Labour Party members and youth activists
🔪 Fatalities: 77 (8 in Oslo bombing, 69 on Utøya)
🚨 Injured: Over 300
🧠 Motive: Far-right extremism, anti-immigration, white supremacist ideology

🔥 Sequence of Events
- 15:25 CEST – Oslo Bombing
Breivik detonated a car bomb outside government buildings in Oslo, killing 8 and injuring dozens. The explosion tore through the Prime Minister’s office and nearby ministries, signaling the start of a coordinated attack.
- 17:22–18:34 CEST – Utøya Island Massacre
Disguised as a police officer, Breivik boarded a ferry to Utøya, where the Labour Party’s youth wing was holding a summer camp. Armed with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle and Glock pistol, he methodically hunted down teenagers for over an hour, killing 69 and wounding many more.

🧨 Weapons Used
- ANFO car bomb (fertilizer-based explosive)
- Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle (.223 caliber)
- Glock 34 pistol (9mm)

⚖️ Trial and Sentencing
- Convictions: 77 counts of murder, terrorism, and causing a fatal explosion
- Sentence: 21 years of preventive detention (Norway’s maximum), with indefinite extensions if deemed a continued threat
- Current Status: Incarcerated at Ringerike Prison, repeatedly denied parole due to ongoing extremist views

🧠 Psychological and Political Impact
Breivik’s manifesto and courtroom behavior revealed deep ideological extremism, including belief in white genocide and Islamophobia. His actions sparked national debates on radicalization, prison ethics, and the limits of free speech.
Norway responded not with vengeance, but with resilience—emphasizing democratic values, openness, and remembrance. Memorials now stand in Oslo and Utøya, honoring the victims and reaffirming the country’s commitment to peace.
