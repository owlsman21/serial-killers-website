Their home is but one of many sun-starved houses crammed together to cater for a disenfranchised society. Jamie longs for an escape from the violence and hopelessness that surrounds him and his salvation arrives in the form of John, a charismatic man who unexpectedly comes to his aid. As John spends more and more time with Jamie's family, Elizabeth and her boys begin to experience a stability and sense of family that they have never known. John moves from the role of Jamie's protector to that of a mentor, indoctrinating Jamie into his world, a world brimming with bigotry, righteousness and malice. Like a son mimicking his father, Jamie soon begins to take on some of John's traits and beliefs as he spends more and more time with him and his select group of friends. The protection and guidance that John presents to Jamie is initially welcomed however as events occur around him, including the disappearance of several people, Jamie begins to harbour deep suspicions about John and his motivations. When the truth is finally revealed to Jamie his hopes of happiness are threatened by both his loyalty for, and fear of, John, his father-figure.

Rader's criminal activities began with the brutal killings of the Otero family, where he bound, tortured, and killed four members. He evaded capture for decades, taunting law enforcement and the media with letters that detailed his crimes, which led to the nickname BTK, standing for Bind, Torture, Kill. Rader's life appeared normal on the surface; he was a family man, worked in various jobs including at a security company, and was active in his church and community.His killing spree came to an abrupt halt in 1979, and Rader seemingly disappeared until he resurfaced in 2004, prompting a renewed investigation that ultimately led to his arrest in 2005. He was sentenced to ten consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. Over the years,",

                "description": "This video is the real life courtroom trial with associated interviews. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer (May 21, 1960 - November 28, 1994) was an American serial killer and sex offender. Dahmer murdered 17 men and boys - most of whom were of African or Asian descent - between 1978 and 1991, with the majority of the murders occurring between 1987 and 1991. His murders were particularly gruesome, involving rape, torture, dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism. On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by fellow Columbia Correctional Institution inmate Christopher Scarver with a bar from a weight machine while on work detail in the prison gym. Jeffrey Dahmer was officially indicted on 17 murder charges, which were reduced to 15. The murder cases were already so notorious that the authorities never bothered to charge him in the attempted murder of Edwards. His trial began on January 30, 1992. With evidence overwhelmingly against him, Dahmer pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial lasted two weeks. The court found Dahmer sane and guilty on 15 counts of murder and sentenced him to 15 life terms, totaling 957 years in prison. At his sentencing hearing, Dahmer expressed remorse for his actions, and said that he wished for his own death. In May of that year, Dahmer was extradited to Ohio, where he entered a plea of guilty for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks. ",

                "description": "In 1994 in Gloucester, England, social services alerted the police to a horrifying rumor they were told by the children of Fred and Rose West. If they misbehaved, the children said, they'd end up under the patio like their sister, Heather, who had not been seen since 1986. Some months later, the police began a search at 25 Cromwell Street, where they would eventually uncover not only the murdered and dismembered remains of Heather, but also eight additional bodies buried in the garden and cellar. So begins the investigation uncovering one of the most heinous and heartless murder sprees in modern history. Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story tells how a couple who were, to those who observed them, in a loving, committed relationship could be capable of such gruesome crimes. Through 107 police interview tapes covering over 50 hours of interrogations, much of it previously unseen and unheard, this three-part docu-series sheds new light on the notorious murders of at least 12 women.",

                "description": "Dennis Rader's killings occurred between 1974 and 1991, during which time he killed a total of 10 people (the first four of whom were killed in one night). Occasionally, he took breaks from killing. Some such periods were around the time that his children were born and he didn't have enough free time to stalk potential victims. During these periods, he would engage in auto-erotic behaviour to keep his urges satisfied. He enjoyed performing self-bondage, sometimes wearing a mask he used during some murders or even female underwear he had taken from his victims. Throughout his serial killing career, Rader sent several taunting letters to the police and media in which he graphically described his murders. The first, written in October 1974, was stashed inside an engineering book in the Wichita Public Library. In 1978, he sent another to Wichita-based TV station KAKE in which he also suggested a number of names for himself, such as The Wichita Strangler, The Wichita Hangman, The Asphyxiater and, the name the public came to know him by, The BTK Killer, signifying his M.O.: Bind, Torture, Kill. The next letters did not come until later. In 2004, the newspaper The Wichita Eagle received a letter from someone using the return address Bill Thomas Killman.",

                "description": "David Berkowitz was born as Richard David Falco. His mother had him out of wedlock when she had an affair with a married real-estate agent named Joseph Klineman. Her husband Tony Falco had left her a few years before that. His mother gave him up for adoption to Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz who named him David Berkowitz Chicago. Being rejected by his birth mother caused David to develop an inferiority complex especially with women and thought he was unappealing to them. He worked as a postman and a security guard. In 1974 he 'heard voices' in his head that ordered him to kill. Berkowitz began to blame these voices on his neighbor Sam Carr's black Labrador that kept him up at night by its barking. He would send hate letters to Carr and in April 1977 even shot and wounded the dog. On July 29, 1976 he killed his first official victim. His modus operandi was to approach unsuspecting people late at night, pull out a gun from a brown paper bag and shoot them at point blank range. Most of his victims were couples, necking in their cars or in a park late at night. His female victims tended to be brunettes with long hair, which caused a scare in parts of New York and had women 'blonding' themselves and cutting their hair short to avoid being targeted. Couples were also advised not to stay out late at night by the local authorities as the serial killings escalated. They were all shot with a .44 caliber bulldog gun and hence his first nickname by the press - .44 Caliber Killer. Most crimes occurred in the boroughs of Bronx and Queens but other parts of the city felt the terror too. The police task force for the case - 'Operation Omega' was formed. Inside the car of one of the victims the police found a letter. One was addressed to Cpt. Joseph Borelli and another to NY columnist Jimmy Breslin (June 1, 1977). The killer identified himself as Sam's and now the press had a new moniker - Son of Sam. The last S.o.S killing took place on July 31, 1977. A witness had seen a young man (David) near the crime scene walking away with something tucked under his jacket. He was observed removing a parking ticket from a yellow Ford Galaxie that had blocked a fire hydrant. The police traced tickets in that area to Berkowitz address in Yonkers. Inside the car they found a loaded .44. They waited for him and when he approached the car they arrested the pudgy unassuming postman. He surrendered without a fight and confessed to being 'Son of Sam'. Though diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic he was found sane enough for trial. On August 23, 1977 he was sentenced to six life sentences.",

                content: `
                    <p>Dennis Rader, known as the BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) Killer, terrorized Wichita, Kansas, for over three decades. His chilling crimes left a trail of death and devastation, but it was his own ego that ultimately led to his downfall.</p>
                    <h2>The Facade of Normalcy</h2>
                    <p>Rader was a seemingly ordinary family man - a husband, father of two, and respected church leader. However, beneath this fa√ßade lay a monster driven by dark fantasies. His double life was a stark contrast to the all-American image he portrayed.</p>
                    <h2>The Crimes</h2>
                    <p>Between 1974 and 1991, Rader murdered 10 people, taunting the police with letters and cryptic clues. His methods were meticulous, often targeting families and leaving behind a twisted signature.</p>
                    <h2>The Ego Takes Over</h2>
                    <p>Rader's arrogance led him to communicate with the police, seeking validation. In 2004, he resumed contact, sending letters and cryptic messages. This communication ultimately led to his capture in 2005.</p>
                    <h2>The Arrest and Aftermath</h2>
                    <p>Rader's DNA was matched to evidence from a crime scene, and he was arrested on February 25, 2005. He confessed to the murders, revealing chilling details. In 2006, he was sentenced to 10 consecutive life terms.</p>
                    <h2>The Psychology Behind BTK</h2>
                    <p>Rader's motivations stemmed from a complex mix of sadistic fantasies, a need for control, and a desire for notoriety. His case highlights the dark side of human nature and the devastating consequences of unchecked desires.</p>
                    <h2>The Legacy of Fear</h2>
                    <p>The BTK Killer's crimes left an indelible mark on Wichita, serving as a grim reminder of the evil that can lurk in seemingly ordinary individuals. Rader's case continues to fascinate and horrify, a testament to the complexities of human psychology.</p>

            <h2>The Ciphers</h2>
            <p>The killer sent numerous letters and ciphers to newspapers, taunting police and media. He claimed the ciphers contained his identity, but only one has ever been definitively solved, revealing a chilling message about his motives and desires.</p>
            <h2>Unsolved Mystery</h2>
            <p>Despite extensive investigations, the Zodiac Killer's identity remains a mystery to this day. His case has become one of the most famous unsolved serial killer cases in history, captivating true crime enthusiasts and inspiring countless theories.</p>
